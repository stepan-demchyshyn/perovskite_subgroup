# Perovskite subgroup file depository

Here you can find useful files and templates that can spimplify creation of figures and panels for thesis writing and publication. 

Both Origin and Jupyter files serve the purpose of procuding individual panels. Panels can be arranged together using an Inkscape template. 

These files and templates are simply guidlines and can be changed at wish. The main purpose of these files is to give a good starting point when creating figures. 

## Colors and colors chemes 

Selection of good color scheme for panels and figures is an important manner which can elevate the quality of your publication. There are several considerations that need to be taken into account when selecting a color scheme, that is an ideal color scheme should be: 
* **Inclusive** 
* **Media independent** 
* **Aestheticly appealing**  

### Inclusive 

There are a number of people (somhwere between 5 and 10% of world population) who have trouble teling the difference between colors. While there are a number of different types of colorblindness, some selection of colors can make your work more accessible to people who percive colors differently.

### Media independent 

Color rendering might vary from screen to screen as well as be cosiderably different when printed on paper. While it is impossible to predict how the reader will se eyour research it is still a good practive to consider potential pitfalls and select colors different in hue and value. 

### Aesthetically appealing

Aesthetics are a matter of preference and are largely subjective. A good idea is to get feeback from your colleagues or suppervisor and see how other find yoru selection of colors.
