# Perovskite subgroup file depository

Here you can find useful files and templates that can spimplify creation of figures and panels for thesis writing and publication. 

Both Origin and Jupyter files serve the purpose of procuding individual panels. Panels can be arranged together using an Inkscape template. 

These files and templates are simply guidlines and can be changed at wish. The main purpose of these files is to give a good starting point when creating figures. 

## Colors and colors chemes
