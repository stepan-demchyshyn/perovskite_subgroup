# Perovskite subgroup file depository

Here you can find useful files and templates that can spimplify creation of figures and panels for thesis writing and publication. 

Both Origin and Jupyter files serve the purpose of producing individual panels. Panels can be arranged together using an Inkscape template. 

These files and templates are simply guidlines and can be changed at wish. The main purpose of these files is to give a good starting point when creating figures. 

## Colors and colors chemes 

Selection of good color scheme for panels and figures is a way in which one can elevate the quality of a publication. There are several considerations that need to be taken into account when selecting a color scheme. An ideal color scheme should be: 
* **Inclusive** 
* **Media independent** 
* **Aestheticly appealing**  

### Inclusive 

There are a number of people (somhwere between 5 and 10% of world population) who have trouble teling the difference between colors. While there are a number of different types of colorblindness, some selection of colors can make your work more accessible to people who percive colors differently. 

Useful sources on the topic include:

| Link  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Paul Tol Notes](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/)  |   An excellent blog with many examples of color schemes for qualitative, diverging, and sequential data sets.  |
| [David Math Logic colorblind tool](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/)  | A great blog that includes a tool to simulate what your chosen color palette would look like to viewers who are colorblind. |


### Media independent 

Color rendering might vary from screen to screen as well as be cosiderably different when printed on paper. While it is impossible to predict how the reader will see your research it is still a good practive to consider potential pitfalls and select colors different enough so that they will look good both on screen and printed on paper. 

### Aesthetically appealing

Great combination of colors can help to highlight the important part of your research as well as make it stand out among a number of other publications. Aesthetics are a matter of preference and are largely subjective. A good idea is to get feeback from your colleagues or suppervisor and see how others like your selection of colors. 

### Ready made color scheme examples

Qualitative color scheme inspired by [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail) (in particular by these two plots: [example 1](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/05/russia-and-kenya-take-the-podium-in-the-athletics-doping-contest) and [example 2](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/28/english-clubs-are-dominating-european-football-once-again)) and a quick simulation of the way it would be percieved by people with different types of colorblindness conditions.

Here is an example of how this color scheme look when used in common plot types.

Also here is an example publication from our group that used the color scheme mentioned above: [Lehner, L. E., Demchyshyn, S., Frank, K., Minenkov, A., Kubicki, D.
