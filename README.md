# Perovskite subgroup file depository

Here you can find useful files and templates that can simplify creation of figures and panels for thesis writing and scientific publications. 

Both Origin and Jupyter files serve the purpose of producing individual panels. Panels can be arranged together using an Inkscape template. 

These files and templates should serve as general guidlines and can be changed at wish. The main purpose of these files is to give a good starting point when creating figures. 

## Colors and colors chemes 

Color is one of the most significant aspects of scientific visualization and selection of good color scheme is a great way to elevate the quality of your work. There are several considerations that need to be taken into account when selecting a color scheme. An ideal color scheme should be: 

* **Inclusive** 
* **Media independent** 
* **Aestheticly appealing**  

### Inclusive 

There are a number of people (0.5% of women and 8% of men) who are subjects to color-vision deficiencies (CVD) or colorblindness. Without a doubt, it is important to  make scientific work as easily understandable as possible and some selection of colors can make it more accessible to people who percive colors differently. 

### Media independent 

Color rendering might vary from screen to screen as well as be cosiderably different when printed on paper. While it is impossible to predict how the reader will see your research it is still a good practive to consider potential pitfalls and select colors different enough so that they will look good both on screen and printed on paper. 

### Aesthetically appealing

Great combination of colors can help to highlight the important part of your research as well as make it stand out among a number of other publications. Aesthetics are a matter of preference and are largely subjective. A good idea is to get feeback from your colleagues or suppervisor and see how others like your selection of colors.

Here is an example of how this color scheme look when used in common plot types.

Also here is an example publication from our group that used the color scheme mentioned above: [Lehner, L. E., Demchyshyn, S., Frank, K., Minenkov, A., Kubicki, D. J., Sun, H., ... & Kaltenbrunner, M. (2022). Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi‚Äê2D Perovskite Solar Cells.
